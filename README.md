# Experimentation Mondays

## Why we do this?

The APInf team organizes bi-weekly Experimentation Mondays. The purpose is to encourage a culture of experimentation and exploration culture. This allows the team members to learn by doing and to get familiar with new technologies. It hopefully will also increase job satisfaction. The experimentations can even be used for very minimal implementations of customer needs.

## Guide lines

* You have to _do_ something - result must be something tangible
* Creating just specs or task lists is not enough (concept building is not doing)

## License

All code results are under EUPL? 

## Ideas as issues

* All ideas in issues. 
* When idea is "used", add comment where is link to results and close the issue. [An example](https://github.com/apinf/experimentation-mondays/issues/2)

## Code results

APIOps is our experimentation community in which we engage with other developers. We encourage other companies to follow our example. 

Thus all code results from Experimentation Mondays go under APIOps organization. https://github.com/apiops. Members of APIOps organization can create repositories. Just create a repository and put all in one place. 


## Feedback
After the day every team member is expected to give feedback about the experimentation day. Use for purpose build API. Use the API via Swagger documentation. (Crafting the API is one experiment)
