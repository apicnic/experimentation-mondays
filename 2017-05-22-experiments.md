# 22.5.2017 Experiments


## Feedback API

* [Mauricio](https://github.com/mauriciovieira)

#### Outcomes

I kept working on the [repository](https://github.com/mauriciovieira/feedbacks-api) (issue #1). It's a rails5 project that uses devise for user handling and jwt for authentication.

The API will be a generic survey api that holds surveys that have questions that have possible answers (all created by admin). And normal user will be able to submit feedbacks to the surveys (using the pre-defined answers or plain text).

This Monday I added role-based authorization for creating surveys, and also created automated tests for that. Started to work on questions models and controllers and that is to be finished on the next experimentation monday.
